# osview

What is "osview"? Back in the days of Silicon Graphics's supremacy over

tool is below:

sought a way to recreate this program for years. Often I have come close, but
before recently I was not able to recreate the proper look and feel of this tool.
Here is a screenshot of my tool as it stands:
